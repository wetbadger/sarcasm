A proposed element for HTML to indicate sarcasm.

# purpose

Web 3.0 is sometimes called the semantic web. HTML, while formerly used to render different styles in the browser (such as marquee), has been reccomended by top industry experts such as Tim Berners-Lee to move towards HTML have purely semantic meanings, so that software can more effectively browse and scrape web content.

This is especially important for individuals with disabilities that effect their ability to see or use the web. With the help of a screen reader a person can have webpages read to them. Extraneous or confusing information, such as in footers, can be left out of the screen readers dictation if the elements have semantic reading.

However, if a passage is intended to convey sarcasm, the screen reader cannot dictate it in a sarcastic voice.
